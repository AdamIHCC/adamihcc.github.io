                    <h2>About Me</h2>
                    <p>
                        My name is Adam Carnicle-Maile, and I am currently a student at Indian Hills Community College.
                        I started going to Indian Hills in June of 2022, and I am currently going through Indian Hills' Computer Software Design program.
                        I have loved computers for most of my life, some of my earliest memories are just me sitting on my father's lap while he was on his computer playing games or working.
                        When I was about 10 I got my first computer, which was just all hand-me-down parts from my fathers's old computer.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Now, at the age of 20, I am at school learning about computers and I hope to eventually make a living working with them. 
                        This portfolio is a demonstration of what I can do with the webpage development skills I learned in my Beginning Webpage Development class.
