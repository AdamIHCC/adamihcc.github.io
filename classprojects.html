                        These are some of my class projects I have had in my Beginning Webpage Development class.
                        You can gauge how far my skills and capabilities have come along by comparing the site you are on now to those old sites.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The first project is the very first pair project we did in class, within the first weeks of the class beginning. 
                        At the time we did not know how to use css, so it was a very bare bones project.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The second project was another pair project with the goal of creating multiple pages for a site, then moving between those pages like you would a normal website.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The final project is a project that was worked on throughout the entire term. 
                        Throughout each unit this site was edited and had things added based off of what was learned in class.
                    </p>
