                    <h2>Our Story</h2>
                    <p>
                        We started out as two ordianry gamers, when one day we realised, we didn't have a gamer microwave. That had to change.

                    <h2>Our Product</h2>
                    <p>
                        Using RGB technology, we developed a working prototype of a gamer microwave. This microwave featured RGB lights in the buttons of the microwave. And eventually, the inside of the microwave will have RGB lighting too.

                    <h2>Our Goal</h2>
                    <p>
                        We want to give gamers more opportunities to be gamers in their everyday lives. Since we all know gamers can't cook, we know the gamer microwave will be a welcome addition to any gamers gaming cave.
