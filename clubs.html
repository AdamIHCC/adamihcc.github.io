                       While I was in high school I was apart of my schools robotics team, the Starmont Sundevils.
                       I joined during my junior year, and mainly worked on building the robot, and throughout the year learned about coding the robot.
                       The code we used was block code since we were a small rural school so more advanced (from perspective) code was not a priority.

                    <p>
                       Back when I was going to Iowa State University I joined the 3D Printing and Design Club.
                       I joined the club to learn more about 3D printing and find people like me, which I did.
                       While I am no longer attending Iowa State, I appreciate the time I spent there and the fun times I had in the club.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was apart of the InMoov team in the club.
                        InMoov is an open source 3D printed life-size robot human.
                        You can learn more about InMoov <a href="https://inmoov.fr/" target="_blank" title="InMoov">here</a> if you so choose.
