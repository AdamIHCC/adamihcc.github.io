                    <p>
                       From when I started high school I was apart of my schools choir.
                       I started singing as a baritone, then moved to singing as a tenor from my sophmore year on.
                       My senior year I became the unofficial lead tenor as I was the only senior tenor.

                    <h2>Starmont High School Band</h2>
                    <p>
                       Just like with choir, I joined band during my freshman year.
                       I was one of the few percussionists my school band had.
                       Because of the size of my highschool, our band did everything from marching band, to concert and contest, to pep band.
                       With how few of us there were, I played the quads for marching band and pep band, and was taught by the senior leaving my freshman year.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       When my junior year came around, I and a friend of mine became the unofficial leaders of the percussion section.
                       The reason why was because our junior year there were no senior percussionists, so that duty fell on us, being the upper classmen.
                       During my junior and senior years I helped teach the underclassmen, as well as helped the band director with his middle school students (mainly the percussionists).
                    </p>
                    <p>
                       I was the recipient of the 2020 John Philip Sousa Band Award at Starmont.

                    <p>
                       While I was in high school I was apart of my schools robotics team, the Starmont Sundevils.
                       I joined during my junior year, and mainly worked on building the robot, and throughout the year learned about coding the robot.
                       The code we used was block code since we were a small rural school so more advanced (from perspective) code was not a priority.

                    <h2>Iowa State 3D Printing and Design Club</h2>
                    <p>
                       Back when I was going to Iowa State University I joined the 3D Printing and Design Club.
                       I joined the club to learn more about 3D printing and find people like me, which I did.
                       While I am no longer attending Iowa State, I appreciate the time I spent there and the fun times I had in the club.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I was apart of the InMoov team in the club.
                        InMoov is an open source 3D printed life-size robot human.
                        You can learn more about InMoov <a href="https://inmoov.fr/" target="_blank" title="InMoov">here</a> if you so choose.
